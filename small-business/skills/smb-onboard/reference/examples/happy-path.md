## Transcript

**Claude:** Welcome! I'm going to walk you through getting set up — takes about 15 minutes and ends with me knowing enough about your business to be immediately useful. Ready?

**Maria:** Sure.

**Claude:** What are your biggest day-to-day headaches — money stuff, keeping up with customers, scheduling, or something else?

**Maria:** Cash flow. I never know where I stand until the end of the month, and by then it's too late.

**Claude:** That's the most common one. Let's connect QuickBooks first — that lets me pull your cash position anytime you need it. Here's how to authorize the connection…

*[Maria connects QuickBooks — ~3 minutes]*

**Claude:** QuickBooks is live. Let me pull your last 30 days of cash flow right now.

*[runs cash-flow-snapshot]*

**Claude:** Here's your snapshot: $4,200 net cash in for the month, but $6,100 in outstanding invoices, mostly from two contractor accounts. Your biggest gap looks like Net-30 customers paying Net-45. Does that match what you're seeing?

**Maria:** Yes, exactly. I didn't know I could see that so fast.

**Claude:** That's available anytime. Second tool: let's connect Gmail so I can cross-reference those invoices with emails when you want to chase a payment.

*[Maria connects Gmail — ~2 minutes]*

**Claude:** Good. A few questions so I know your business — one at a time. What's the one-liner for what you do?

**Maria:** Hardware store. Retail and light contractor supply.

**Claude:** How many people work with you, including yourself?

**Maria:** Four total — me and three part-timers.

**Claude:** What are your top three headaches right now?

**Maria:** Cash flow, slow-paying contractors, and scheduling the part-timers around school.

**Claude:** Which tools do you already use day-to-day?

**Maria:** QuickBooks and Gmail, which we just connected. Also Square for in-store payments.

**Claude:** Got it. Last one: how often would you like me to check in — daily, weekly, or only when you ask?

**Maria:** Weekly's good. Monday mornings.

**Claude:** Here's what I'm about to save as your business profile — let me know if anything's off:

```
Business: Hardware store — retail and light contractor supply
Size: 4 people (including owner)
Top headaches: cash flow gaps · slow-paying contractors · scheduling part-timers
Connected tools: QuickBooks, Gmail
Weekly cadence: weekly check-in every Monday
Onboarded: 2026-04-23
```

Look right?

**Maria:** Yep, that's it.

**Claude:** Saved. Every skill from here will know your business. Each Monday, just say "weekly check-in" and I'll pull your cash snapshot, flag urgent invoices, and remind you what's due that week. Want to try the invoice reminder skill right now? Say "invoice chase."
