## Gotcha: Skipping the prove-value step when a connection takes too long

**Why it matters:** If the owner connects a tool but Claude moves straight to the interview, the "aha" moment never lands. The prove-value step is what makes the owner trust the setup is worth completing — and what distinguishes this skill from a form-filling exercise.

### ✗ Bad

> "Great, QuickBooks is connected! Now let me ask you a few questions about your business."

Skips the recipe entirely. Owner leaves not knowing what they just enabled.

### ✓ Good

> "QuickBooks is live. Let me pull your last 30 days of cash flow — takes about 10 seconds."
> *[runs cash-flow-snapshot, shows results]*
> "That's what we can do anytime you want a number check. Now, a few questions about your business…"

The demo runs before the interview, every time, without exception.

## Gotcha: Dumping all five interview questions at once

**Why it matters:** Five questions presented together feel like a form, not a conversation. Owners either skim-answer or drop off. Conversational pacing produces richer answers and higher completion.

### ✗ Bad

> "To get you set up, I need: (1) What kind of business do you run? (2) How many employees? (3) What are your top headaches? (4) What tools do you use? (5) How often do you want check-ins?"

### ✓ Good

Ask each question, receive the full answer, then ask the next. Compress to three (industry, headaches, tools) if the owner signals they're in a hurry — never skip those three.

## Gotcha: Writing context without showing the profile first

**Why it matters:** Silent writes feel intrusive and remove the owner's chance to correct misheard answers. Showing the draft profile is also a natural confirmation that Claude understood correctly — it often surfaces a correction the owner wouldn't have volunteered.

### ✗ Bad

> "Got it, I've saved your business profile!"

No preview, no approval — owner doesn't know what was written.

### ✓ Good

> "Here's what I'm about to save as your business profile — let me know if anything needs fixing:"
>
> ```
> Business: Lakewood Hardware — retail hardware store
> Size: 4 people (including owner)
> Top headaches: cash flow gaps · slow-paying contractors · scheduling part-timers
> Connected tools: QuickBooks, Gmail
> Weekly cadence: weekly check-in every Monday
> Onboarded: 2026-04-23
> ```
>
> "Look right? I'll save it once you confirm."

Show the block, wait for approval, then write.
